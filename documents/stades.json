It is also sometimes used for the Moroccan national team and for other FIFA and CAF international football matches as a neutral venue.\nThe construction project began on paper in 2003, with the idea of building the stadium for Morocco's failed 2006 FIFA World Cup bid. In 2007, the project resumed, but it was only completed in time for its inauguration in 2013, the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup that year. It has also hosted the 2018 African Nations Cup.\nThe Adrar Stadium, with a capacity of 45,480, is mostly used for club football matches in the Botola Pro League, but it is also a host for occasional football matches for the Moroccan national team, a neutral venue for CAF friendlies and tournament qualifiers, and a music concert venue. As of 2024, renovations are under way to increase its capacity ahead of international football tournaments to be hosted by Morocco in 2025 and 2030.",
